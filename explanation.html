        <h1>EXPLANATION</h1>
        <p>
            If you are broken here on this website you have broken the key and know that the code is "TRUST GOD IN THE STORM". There are primary points in the large maze that will take down the page. The spiritual incentive of a tornado hence the title of the artwork is "Tornadic Storm". Inside the tornado there are 100 printed Braille words, each on being a "storm" someone may go through in life. The maze is the metaphor for how we navigate our way through life. We may get lost or turn around, but there is only one correct way to the end, that being Jesus. As you complete the maze you get letters in total and when arranged in order you get the answer. The artwork is a statement on trusting God as we navigate the storm of life.
